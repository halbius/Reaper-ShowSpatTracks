# Reaper-ShowSpatTracks
Shows tracks containing audio and the corresponding send tracks with SpatRevolutions LAP-Send

The audio tracks are displayed in a collapsed state, while the send tracks, which contain the plugin automation, fit the rest of the TCP.
Only works with Reavolution and when send tracks are created with JLP's command, as it identifys the send track by their name.
